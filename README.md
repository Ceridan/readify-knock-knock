# Readify Knock! Knock! API implementation
This project is my implementation of the funny recruitment process task from the [Readify](https://knockknock.readify.net/).
The main purpose is to build end-to-end simple Web API with Docker containerization and full CI/CD pipeline and also validate final result with Readify checking system.
